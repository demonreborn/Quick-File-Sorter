# Quick-File-Sorter
Sort files in a folder directory of your choosing by moving files with the extension of your choosing to a folder (you guessed it) of your choosing.


# Why?
Quick python experiment to sort files with a specific extension to a specific folder.


# Scenario Example
Need to sort specific media files out of your downloads folder by extension type? (IE Music .mp3) File Sorter can do that quickly and easily for you! Just select your target and output folders. File sorter can handle moving hundreds (perhaps even thousands?) of files for you.
